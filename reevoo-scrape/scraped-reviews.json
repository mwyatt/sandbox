I have listened to silver plated cables before and have not been totally convinced of their musicality, but that does not happen to the havana, it sounds like copper but the added silver gives this cable incredible detail and neutrality, personally I am glad I tried because this cable will be staying in my system for a long time.",

The cable has a very gentle and articulate manor about it. This is not to say it's laid back and soft because it isn't. The mid range is silky and the highs are controlled very well without shouting at you. The bass is tight but only after running in so you will need to be patient with it and not expect 100% to begin with. The overall detail you get from this cable is actually very impressive and I love the way it simply presents the music to me instead of throwing it at me. Soundstage is good and the imaging is right where I like it. I have tried many cables all of which were double and beyond the price of this cable and I can tell you this cable outperforms it's price tag beyond all of my expectations. I liked it so much I bought a good bit more to kit out various other systems I have.",

I enjoyed it most, when I used two of these cables for both left &amp; right digital amp pre out channels. Because it enhances the front main stereo image. It sounds so realistic when I listen to music; everyone believes the controllable bass is coming out of my main front pair of floor standing speakers and not the subwoofer. This is specifically what was missing from my digital amp set ups, in the past. N\/b this worked even better with the dig amp on screen menu subwoofer switched to off. And it also excelled with my pals very powerful, dedicated home cinema set up.<br>What an improvement, a real must buy bargain.<br>",
